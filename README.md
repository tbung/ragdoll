# RAGdoll

- I want my own way to search through stuff
- I don't want to guess at search terms for that
- Use RAG and a LLM
- Everything local if at all possible

## Ideas

### Definitely want this for PDFs

- `pdftotext` should be fine for that
- Zotero would already be supported as a folder full of PDFs
- Maybe Zotero paper titles would also be nice in there
- Zotero plugin so we can auto-update when new stuff is added

### Definitely want this for Markdown documents

- Already text, which is nice
- Do we need to strip formatting?
- Automatically add new documents when search is run -> cached
